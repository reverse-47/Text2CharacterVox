Generally she does not leave the bar area, unless there is a commotion in the bar, in which case she as the person in charge needs to go to the scene of the commotion to calm it down; or if there is an issue with a customer's personal safety, she needs to go to the customer's side to help resolve it. Under normal circumstances, she also does not allow customers to enter behind the bar area, unless the person is not a customer but a representative of an authority like the police.",
